    "text": "Have you come across the ‘Record Scratch Freeze Frame Yep, That’s me.’ meme?\nLike this one\n\nYou can see more of these on YouTube. I just happened to pick this one because it is hilarious and is from one of my favorite movies of all time (Spider-Man 2).\nInterestingly enough, no one knows the exact origin of this meme. When I tried to dig in, I came across this opening sequence of the movie Premium Rush (2012). However, the scene itself does not include the phrase. According to Knowyourmeme.com, this meme’s origin could be traced back to the “Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode III.\nAnyways, why am I talking about this meme on my front page? Well because that’s exactly how I feel right now writing this.\nI kind of feel like Tobey Maguire from that earlier clip or like Joe Gordon Lewitt from that opening sequence of Premium Rush except I am not in an immediate danger of getting bumped into a wall from a failed web swing attempt or about to taste the pavement because of New York’s traffic. I assure you I am not in any of these situations. Instead picture me sitting in front of a laptop trying to learn about Deep Learning and Machine Learning. The frame pauses right as in it zooms on my face and you hear a voice:\n‘Yup, That’s me. You are probably wondering how I ended up in that situation.’\nSo how does an Environment and Business undergraduate from the University of Waterloo who is passionate about sustainable finance ends up writing a blog (?) that is going to talk about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistics, Data Analytics and other topics?\nThat’s what I want to this blog to be!\nBut since this is supposed to my first post, I want to give you a gist of what actually motivated me to share this journey with others?\nI actually got to thank two individuals:\na) Max Tegmark: I recently finished reading Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark and I will just say if you haven’t read this book, I would highly recommend you to check it out. This book was the first book to ever make me excited about a subject area! Talking about how great that book is in this post would be a disservice from my end. I will just say for now that one of the themes that Max touches upon is the idea that the age of artificial intelligence is going to have an impact across all corners of life. While we do need the brightest minds working on these topics, Max argues that It’s not just the job of scientists, physicists, researchers and philosophers to think about ’what kind of future do we want? Because if we ourselves don’t know about what kind of future do we want, how can we expect to work towards it, much less build Average General Intelligence (AGI)? Max’s argument can be beautifully summed up by Seneca\n“If a man knows not which port he sails, no wind is favorable.”\nb) Jeremy Howard: I came across fast.ai after picking up Life 3.0 and as I was browsing the website for ‘Practical Deep Learning for Coders’. I was skimming through the first few paragraphs and my initial reaction was\nHmm. this looks interesting. Let’s see what else is there.\nA few paragraphs led to a few pages and before I knew it I came across the section on ‘Deep Learning for Everyone’. When I saw the myth get busted by ‘Lot of Math’ not required, I had a huge sigh of relief!\nA few years ago when I came across the terms ‘Machine Learning’ , ‘Deep Learning’, ‘Neural Networks’; I pictured a bunch of computer scientists, researchers and mathematicians from MIT working on the most complicated theorems and equations of advanced mathematics one can probably imagine. Oh, did I mention they were wearing white labcoats?\n\n\n\nAn 18 year old Aryamik’s version of what it takes to work on Machine Learning\n\n\nThis Vince McMohan meme can probably sum up my reactions as I read through the first few sections of that course.\n\n\n\n\n\nJokes aside, Jeremy went on talk about how Deep Learning is indeed for everyone.\nThe idea that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are transversal across sectors is something that reminds of something similar that I came across when I was preparing for Sustainability and Climate Risk Certification.Climate risk is an area that is also transversal in nature, meaning that it is not just going to have an impact on the ‘E’ side of the ESG, but also on the ‘S’ and the ‘G’.\nWhenever someone asks me about my interests, I usually walk them through this venn diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intersection of these areas represents the areas that I am really passionate to work on. However, if you were to ask me the same question today, I believe that this model will probably do a better job of explaining my interest areas!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could say that I am just a guy who is curious to learn more about these cross-functional domains can possibly interact with each other. It is about my own journey as I try to decipher these seemingly complex topics.\nBut I don’t want to give off the impression that this is just going to be a ‘data science blog’. Yes, I want to primarily talk about the domain of ESG, Data Analytics, Machine Learning. I want to share my own thoughts and resources along the way, explore some of the practical cases of Machine Learning and ESG. After all, what good is knowledge if you don’t get to share it with others?\nBut I don’t just want this to be just a Machine Learning blog or an ESG blog. I want to talk about philosophical themes as they emerge (Seneca’s quote counts right?), sprinkle in some pop cultural references (Spider-Man 2, Premium Rush) or maybe just explore the theory behind the additive assumption in Linear Models.\nI want to be excited about doing this! Something clearly excited me about this project. Maybe it was the prospect of using Spider-Man memes or maybe it’s just a tool that I am using to learn these concepts? After all they say that there is no better test of your understanding of a topic than attempting to teach it to somebody else.\nI want to see how this evolves.\nFor now, you could think of this as a ‘journal’ that I want to share with people as I embark upon this journey.\nSo there you have it folks. Now that you know a little bit about what this blog is all about, hop on along for the journey. Or at the very least stay here for the memes and the pop-culture references."

    "text": "TL;DR\n\n\n\n\nBoth R and Python are amazing programming languages that can be used for a vast majority of use cases\nKnowing what to use and when to use it is highly contextual\nFocus on learning the concepts and applying them\n\n\n\nDo you remember the scene in Batman vs Superman where Superman confronts Lex Luthor at the top of Lex Corp? Lex asks Superman to fight Batman and says:\n\nBlack and blue. Fight night. The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world: God versus man; day versus night; Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham!\n\nHere’s the scene:\n\nSometimes that’s what most of the debates on the internet feel like. Except they are not. The R vs Python is no such exception. It feels as if its the clash of the titans. But spoiler alert: it’s not!\nThe other day I came across this amazing meme and as a fan of both Wile E. Coyote and The Flash, I couldn’t help but laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew days later, I saw this format used in the context of data science.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt got me thinking about what if it is true?\n\nIs Python better than R? Or is it the other way round?\n\nThis post is not going to go into the specifics. Instead I will just link some amazing resources that will provide some more information.\n\n\nPython vs R for Data Science: Which Should You Learn?\nPython or R for Data Analysis: Which Should I Learn?\nPython vs. R: What's the Difference?\n\n\n\nIn this graph, we can see that over the past few years Python has emerged to be one of the most popular programming languages. Even the results from Stack Overflow’s surveys since have supported this claim. Nearly 49.3% of survey respondents (out of 87,585 responses) used Python. For R, it was 4.23%. Similarly, Python ranks first in several programming language popularity indices such as the Popularity of Programming Language Index (PYPL) and the TIOBE Programming Community index.\nSo what does this mean to the ‘R vs Python’ debate? Is it settled then? Do we have a ‘winner’?\nThe truth is there is no ‘debate’ or a ‘fight’ in first place. I know it sounds silly but it all depends on the context.\nPython is a high-level, general purpose programming language and focuses on high readability and interpretability. The ‘general purpose’ part of Python allows it to be used across various programming domains such as data science, web development, software development and gaming. Since its use cases span across multiple domains, it makes sense why it happens to be one of the most popular languages.\nR on the other hand was created specifically for statistical analysis. As a result, it has become the go-to language in academia, research, finance and data science. When my brother started working at his first job, he began his data science journey using R. Almost all of his projects were exclusively based in R. His journey later inspired me to start my own data science journey with R.\nWe need to understand that there is a difference between creating a language that can be leveraged for statistical analysis and a language that can do a lot of things with statistical analysis being one of them. This is something that is not so apparent when we skim through the survey results and indices. What if the surveys were targeted towards audiences in academia? The results may tell us a totally different story. Or how about surveys that asks respondents which programming language has better visualization capabilities? The results might lean towards R.\nThis is something that I can vouch for as well. When I first started using ggplot2 in R, my reaction was:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now, we have this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best part about both these languages is that both Python and R have robust and extensive ecosystems and a vast community of users and developers who ensure the smooth growth and improvement of the respective languages, as well as the continuous release of new libraries designed for all kinds of purposes. In other words, one can use either language for a vast majority of the use cases.\nTrue wisdom lies in knowing the strengths of both and knowing when to use them. If you are working with your fellow postgraduates on a research project that requires you to do some statistical analysis, it would be a good idea to use R. Similarly if your day-to-day involves web scraping or automating tasks, then writing scripts in Python would be a better decision.\nAt the end of the day, all these ‘debates’ and ‘comparisons’ don’t matter. Jeremy from fast.ai sums it up beautifully:\n\nHowever, it doesn’t really matter what software you learn, because it takes only a few days to learn to switch from one library to another. What really matters is learning the deep learning foundations and techniques properly. Our focus will be on using code that, as clearly as possible, expresses the concepts that you need to learn. Where we are teaching high-level concepts, we will use high-level fastai code. Where we are teaching low-level concepts, we will use low-level PyTorch or even pure Python code.\nThough it may seem like new deep learning libraries are appearing ata rapid pace nowadays, you need to be prepared for a much faster rate of change in the coming months and years. As more people enter the field, they will bring more skills and ideas, and try more things. You should assume that whatever specific libraries and software you learn today will be obsolete in a year or two. Just think about the number of changes in libraries and technology stacks that occur all the time in the world of web programming—a much more mature and slow-growing area than deep learning. We strongly believe that the focus in learning needs to be on understanding the underlying techniques and how to apply them in practice, and how to quickly build expertise in new tools and techniques as they are released.\n\nWhen I was learning to play Bass, I was inspired by a lot of heavy metal bands. I wanted to learn all the amazing riffs that my idols used to play. When I did some research and looked up their histories, I realized that a lot of them came from different musical backgrounds such as jazz, blues, contemporary. For example, one of my favorite guitarists of all time, Synyster Gates started out as a jazz musician and so did his father Brian Haner. It is no surprise that almost all of Avenged Sevenfold’s riffs have pentatonics and diminished arpeggios. It is fairly common knowledge among musicians to not confine yourself to a particular genre. Don’t just be a metal musician, or a jazz musician , or a blues musician.\nI believe same logic can be applied to the world of data science. As long as you know ‘what’ is happening under the hood, you can easily apply that to any other language. Use R. Use Python. Or use both because why not? Think of them as tools that you can add to your data science toolbox.\nSo which programming language is good?\nHere’s your answer:\nvia GIPHY \nOne last meme to put this topic to bed:\n\n\n\n\n\n(P.S. I am going to miss Henry Cavill in the next season of Witcher 😢)"

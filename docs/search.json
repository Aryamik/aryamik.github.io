    "section": "Sustainability Targets and Initiatives",
    "text": "Sustainability Targets and Initiatives\nLet’s take a look at another example of where Goodhart’s law maybe applicable - sustainability targets and initiatives.\nFollowing the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) in which stated that\n\n“Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic [human-caused] CO2 emissions and declining net non-CO2 radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal timescales.\n\nEver since then, there has been significant growth in the number of actors pledging net zero emissions. Many standards such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and International Sustainability Standards have emerged that interpret the net zero concept and aim to measure progress towards net zero targets. The rise of these standards have led to the (re)emergence of various policies and mechanisms such as carbon offsets.\nThe idea behind a carbon offset is that when an entity releases greenhouse gases, they can pay someone else to remove an equivalent amount of climate pollution from the atmosphere. For example, if an automotive manufacturer in a developed country that wants to claim it is reducing its emissions, the manufacturer can pay for a patch of rainforest to be protected in the Amazon that can absorb an equal amount of emissions. This in theory – cancels out - or offsets the impact of the automotive manufacturer emissions.\nOne can see the appeal for carbon offsets. For many industries, the cost of addressing their own emissions can be a huge undertaking. By directly funding offset projects, the cost of addressing climate change becomes more manageable. It sounds pretty straightforward, right?\nIt is all fun and games until you take a look at the reality.\nHow it started:\n\n\n\nSource: Marketplace.org\n\n\nHow it’s going:\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg.org\n\n\nCarbon offsets have been there since 1970s. So what went wrong along the way?\nKeeping aside the limitations of carbon offsets such as overstated baselines, double counting of emissions, additionality; one can see how Goodhart’s law might be at play here.\nConsider a simple example. A dairy farm wants to setup its operations in California. This means the dairy farm will have to clear 1 hectare of land to be up and running. Theoretically, the dairy farm could offset its impact by planting 1 hectare of vegetation in Amazon. Soon enough, this will prompt other dairy farms to do the same thing and before you know it hundreds of acres of lands have been cleared in California. But you might say : ‘Aren’t they making up for their impacts by offsetting their emissions in Amazon?’\nPartially yes. But 1 hectare of land in California is not the same as 1 hectare of land in Amazon. This has been one of the criticisms of carbon offsets where offset projects tend to encourage ‘business as usual’ practices without considering the ecological complexities of the different regions.\nThe organizations can claim to be carbon neutral (which on paper they might be). But in the end, are we really ‘solving’ for the underlying problem?"

    "section": "Biodiversity Conservation",
    "text": "Biodiversity Conservation\nSimilarly, Goodhart’s law finds it way in a related area - protecting biodiversity.\nRapid declines in populations of various vulnerable species have led to their inclusion in direct measures of biodiversity such as International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Red List Index (RLI). The Index is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™, which is widely considered to be the leading assessment of the extinction risk of species. The Red List involves the application of quantitative criteria based on population size, distribution area, and rate of decline, to assign species to different categories of relative extinction risk.\nAs a result, a substantial research effort has been devoted to examining the causes of decline in these vulnerable species. This has led to increases in conservation efforts which have had some success in slowing or even reversing the observed declines. At first glance, this can viewed as a success story. However, it has also potentially undermined the use of these species as a sustainability indicator. As policy and management interventions have focused specifically on vulnerable species, with the aim of improving this indicator, abundance of these species is arguably now less representative of the general state of the natural environment than it was hitherto. Consequently, any increase in the indicator is more likely to be a measure of specific response actions than of any general improvement in the state of the environment."

    "section": "Way Forward",
    "text": "Way Forward\nThese examples illustrate the central theme of Goodhart’s law, that is: once a measure is declared as important and policy aims to reduce it, the underlying correlation will be reduced.\nThis post is not meant to be a criticism of carbon offsets, sustainability standards or measures as a whole. As someone who is part of the ‘what gets measured, gets managed’ crowd, I still believe that measures still serve an important purpose.\nBut given what we know about Goodhart’s law, two key questions emerge:\n\nWhy does it happen?\nWhat can we do about it?\n\nIn the episode, Jeremie explains this happens because you end up baking in some misalignment between what you want and what the system wants. The more powerful that system becomes the the more it exploits that gap. People will tend to affect any given indicator/measure in whichever ways can be most readily achieved. As a result, indicators become decoupled from underlying process that they are supposed to indicate, and indicator values will become artificially inflated without addressing the underlying problem.\nThat takes care of the ‘why it happens’ part. Now how do we actually address it?\nBefore coming up with ways to quantify something, we should be really clear with what are we trying to solve for? Do I want to track my daily weight or do I want to be the healthiest version of myself? Do I want to offset my emissions or do I want to make sure the global ecosystems are protected?\nOnce we are clear on the problem we are trying to solve, we should then think of all the possible ways in which the given indicator/measure could be exploited/gamified. How could our measure of choice become decoupled from the underlying process?\nSometimes we won’t have clear answers to to these questions, especially when we are trying to solve a novel problem where there has been no precedence. However, considering some of the confounding variables at the onset of the process could help us ensure that our measures are aligned with what we are trying to solve for.\nFinally, systems should be put in place to prevent manipulation of the indicators and the assessments on which they are based, to ensure that the information they provide is objective and reliable. Using multiple indicator sets, including measures of pressure as well as state variables, could help reduce scope for indicator manipulation.\nIn conclusion, measures serve an important function in guiding decision-making and assessing progress toward goals. However, there is a need for caution in interpreting the information provided by any measure that are used; at best, they can only provide a partial indication of the status and trends of the process we are trying to assess, and this needs to be appreciated by the decision-makers who employ them."

For many industries, the cost of addressing their own emissions can be a huge undertaking. By directly funding offset projects, the cost of addressing climate change becomes more manageable. It sounds pretty straightforward, right?\nIt is all fun and games until you take a look at the reality.\nHow it started:\n\n\n\nSource: Marketplace.org\n\n\nHow it’s going:\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg.org\n\n\nCarbon offsets have been there since 1970s. So what went wrong along the way?\nKeeping aside the limitations of carbon offsets such as overstated baselines, double counting of emissions, additionality; one can see how Goodhart’s law might be at play here.\nConsider a simple example. A dairy farm wants to setup its operations in California. This means the dairy farm will have to clear 1 hectare of land to be up and running. Theoretically, the dairy farm could offset its impact by planting 1 hectare of vegetation in Amazon. Soon enough, this will prompt other dairy farms to do the same thing and before you know it hundreds of acres of lands have been cleared in California. But you might say : ‘Aren’t they making up for their impacts by offsetting their emissions in Amazon?’\nPartially yes. But 1 hectare of land in California is not the same as 1 hectare of land in Amazon. This has been one of the criticisms of carbon offsets where offset projects tend to encourage ‘business as usual’ practices without considering the ecological complexities of the different regions. As a result, organizations can claim to be carbon neutral (which on paper they might be). But in the end, are we really ‘solving’ for the underlying problem?"

    "text": "Biodiversity Conservation\nSimilarly, Goodhart’s law finds it way in a related area - protecting biodiversity.\nRapid declines in populations of various vulnerable species have led to their inclusion in direct measures of biodiversity such as International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Red List Index (RLI). The Index is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™, which is widely considered to be the leading assessment of the extinction risk of species. The Red List involves the application of quantitative criteria based on population size, distribution area, and rate of decline, to assign species to different categories of relative extinction risk.\nA substantial research effort has been devoted to examining the causes of decline in these vulnerable species using the indicators used in RLI. This has led to increases in conservation efforts which have had some success in slowing or even reversing the observed declines. At first glance, this can viewed as a success story. However, it has also potentially undermined the use of these species as a sustainability indicator. As policy and management interventions have focused specifically on vulnerable species, with the aim of improving this indicator, abundance of these species is arguably now less representative of the general state of the natural environment than it was hitherto. Consequently, any increase in the indicator is more likely to be a measure of specific response actions than of any general improvement in the state of the environment."

    "text": "Way Forward\nThese examples illustrate the central theme of Goodhart’s law, that is\n\nOnce a measure is declared as important and policy aims to reduce it, the underlying correlation will be reduced.\n\nThis post is not meant to be a criticism of carbon offsets, sustainability standards or measures as a whole. As someone who is part of the ‘what gets measured, gets managed’ crowd, I still believe that measures serve an important purpose.\nBut given what we know about Goodhart’s law, two key questions emerge:\n\nWhy does it happen?\nWhat can we do about it?\n\nIn the episode, Jeremie explains this happens because you end up baking in some misalignment between what you want and what the system wants. The more powerful that system becomes the the more it exploits that gap. People will tend to affect any given indicator/measure in whichever ways can be most readily achieved. As a result, indicators become decoupled from underlying process that they are supposed to indicate, and indicator values will become artificially inflated without addressing the underlying problem.\nThat takes care of the ‘why’. Now how do we actually address it?\nBefore coming up with ways to quantify something, we should be really clear with what are we trying to solve for? Do I want to track my daily weight or do I want to be the healthiest version of myself? Do I want to offset my emissions or do I want to make sure the global ecosystems are protected?\nOnce we are clear on the problem we are trying to solve, we should then think of all the possible ways in which the given indicator/measure could be exploited/gamified. How could our measure of choice become decoupled from the underlying process?\nSometimes we won’t have clear answers to to these questions, especially when we are trying to solve a novel problem where there has been no precedence. However, considering some of the confounding variables at the onset of the process could help us ensure that our measures are aligned with what we are trying to solve for.\nFinally, systems should be put in place to prevent manipulation of the indicators and the assessments on which they are based, to ensure that the information they provide is objective and reliable. Using multiple indicator sets, including measures of pressure as well as state variables, could help reduce scope for indicator manipulation.\nIn conclusion, measures serve an important function in guiding decision-making and assessing progress toward goals. However, there is a need for caution in interpreting the information provided by any measure that are used; at best, they can only provide a partial indication of the status and trends of the process we are trying to assess, and this needs to be appreciated by the decision-makers who employ them."

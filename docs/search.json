    "title": "R vs Python",
    "section": "",
    "text": "TL;DR\n\n\n\n\nBoth R and Python are amazing programming languages that can be used for a vast majority of use cases\nKnowing what to use and when to use it is highly contextual\nFocus on learning the concepts and applying them\n\n\n\nDo you remember the scene in Batman vs Superman where Superman confronts Lex Luthor at the top of Lex Corp? Lex asks Superman to fight Batman and says:\n\nBlack and blue. Fight night. The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world: God versus man; day versus night; Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham!\n\nHere’s the scene:\n\nSometimes that’s what most of the debates on the internet feel like. Except they are not. The R vs Python is no such exception. It feels as if its the clash of the titans. But spoiler alert: it’s not!\nThe other day I came across this amazing meme and as a fan of both Wile E. Coyote and The Flash, I couldn’t help but laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nFew days later, I saw this format used in the context of data science.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt got me thinking about what if it is true?\n\nIs Python better than R? Or is it the other way round?\n\nThis post is not going to go into the specifics. Instead I will just link some amazing resources that will provide some more information.\n\n\nPython vs R for Data Science: Which Should You Learn?\nPython or R for Data Analysis: Which Should I Learn?\nPython vs. R: What’s the Difference?\n\n\n\nIn this graph, we can see that over the past few years Python has emerged to be one of the most popular programming languages. Even the results from Stack Overflow’s surveys since have supported this claim. Nearly 49.3% of survey respondents (out of 87,585 responses) used Python. For R, it was 4.23%. Similarly, Python ranks first in several programming language popularity indices such as the Popularity of Programming Language Index (PYPL) and the TIOBE Programming Community index.\nSo what does this mean to the ‘R vs Python’ debate? Is it settled then? Do we have a ‘winner’?\nThe truth is there is no ‘debate’ or a ‘fight’ in first place. I know it sounds silly but it all depends on the context.\nPython is a high-level, general purpose programming language and focuses on high readability and interpretability. The ‘general purpose’ part of Python allows it to be used across various programming domains such as data science, web development, software development and gaming. Since its use cases span across multiple domains, it makes sense why it happens to be one of the most popular languages.\nR on the other hand was created specifically for statistical analysis. As a result, it has become the go-to language in academia, research, finance and data science. When my brother started working at his first job, he began his data science journey using R. Almost all of his projects were exclusively based in R. His journey later inspired me to start my own data science journey with R.\nWe need to understand that there is a difference between creating a language that can be leveraged for statistical analysis and a language that can do a lot of things with statistical analysis being one of them. This is something that is not so apparent when we skim through the survey results and indices. What if the surveys were targeted towards audiences in academia? The results may tell us a totally different story. Or how about surveys that asks respondents which programming language has better visualization capabilities? The results might lean towards R.\nThis is something that I can vouch for as well. When I first started using ggplot2 in R, my reaction was:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now, we have this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best part about both these languages is that both Python and R have robust and extensive ecosystems and a vast community of users and developers who ensure the smooth growth and improvement of the respective languages, as well as the continuous release of new libraries designed for all kinds of purposes. In other words, one can use either language for a vast majority of the use cases.\nTrue wisdom lies in knowing the strengths of both and knowing when to use them. If you are working with your fellow postgraduates on a research project that requires you to do some statistical analysis, it would be a good idea to use R. Similarly if your day-to-day involves web scraping or automating tasks, then writing scripts in Python would be a better decision.\nAt the end of the day, all these ‘debates’ and ‘comparisons’ don’t matter. Jeremy from fast.ai sums it up beautifully:\n\nHowever, it doesn’t really matter what software you learn, because it takes only a few days to learn to switch from one library to another. What really matters is learning the deep learning foundations and techniques properly. Our focus will be on using code that, as clearly as possible, expresses the concepts that you need to learn. Where we are teaching high-level concepts, we will use high-level fastai code. Where we are teaching low-level concepts, we will use low-level PyTorch or even pure Python code.\nThough it may seem like new deep learning libraries are appearing ata rapid pace nowadays, you need to be prepared for a much faster rate of change in the coming months and years. As more people enter the field, they will bring more skills and ideas, and try more things. You should assume that whatever specific libraries and software you learn today will be obsolete in a year or two. Just think about the number of changes in libraries and technology stacks that occur all the time in the world of web programming—a much more mature and slow-growing area than deep learning. We strongly believe that the focus in learning needs to be on understanding the underlying techniques and how to apply them in practice, and how to quickly build expertise in new tools and techniques as they are released.\n\nWhen I was learning to play Bass, I was inspired by a lot of heavy metal bands. I wanted to learn all the amazing riffs that my idols used to play. When I did some research and looked up their histories, I realized that a lot of them came from different musical backgrounds such as jazz, blues, contemporary. For example, one of my favorite guitarists of all time, Synyster Gates started out as a jazz musician and so did his father Brian Haner. It is no surprise that almost all of Avenged Sevenfold’s riffs have pentatonics and diminished arpeggios. It is fairly common knowledge among musicians to not confine yourself to a particular genre. Don’t just be a metal musician, or a jazz musician , or a blues musician.\nI believe same logic can be applied to the world of data science. As long as you know ‘what’ is happening under the hood, you can easily apply that to any other language. Use R. Use Python. Or use both because why not? Think of them as tools that you can add to your data science toolbox.\nSo which programming language is good?\nHere’s your answer:\nvia GIPHY \nOne last meme to put this topic to bed:\n\n\n\n\n\n(P.S. I am going to miss Henry Cavill in the next season of Witcher 😢)"

The whole episode had interesting tidbits that I really liked but for this post, I wanted to focus on just one segment - the economic principle of ‘Goodhart’s law’. They discuss it around 56:30:\nThis led me into a rabbit hole of Goodhart’s law and what it is all about. It can be traced back to 1975 when the British economist Charles Goodhart expressed this idea in his article “Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience”. In the article Goodhart explains:\nSimply put\nGoodhart’s law was originally developed in the context of conducting monetary policy on the basis of targets. However, its application can be observed in many other areas. Here are some other applications of Goodhart’s law that I can think of:"

    "text": "My Fitness Journey\nAfter hearing about Goodhart’s law, It got me thinking about my own fitness journey. When I was just starting out, I used to get so fixated on the number on weighing scale because in my head I rationalized it as:\nLower weight on the weighing scale = Being closer to my fitness goals.\nI became so obsessed with the number that I saw on the weighing scale everyday that I started ‘gaming’ the system. I started pulling off some shenanigans like being over zealous with my cardio, being extremely restrictive with my calories so that the next day the scale would read the number that I wanted to see. It got to a point where I lost track of my broader fitness goals and why I was doing it in the first place - to stay fit and be more healthy.\nIt wasn’t until many years later that I realized that I was doing it all wrong. It occurred me to that weight is one of the many metrics that can be used to gauge your progress. It can serve as a proxy for your fitness journey but it is not the end all be all metric that is worth obsessing over. Not only that, but relying solely on a weight loss scale for fitness progress can be misleading. Turns out many variables affect your body weight, such as:\n\nSleep\nCarbohydrate intake\nSodium intake\nFiber\nMenstrual cycle\nFood volume\nConstipation\nStress\nHydration\n\nTherefore even if you are giving 100%, the numbers on weighing scale can fluctuate easily.\nSo what does this tell? Being obsessed with chasing a particular metric (in this case the number on weighing scale) ends up telling nothing about what I wanted to measure in the first place."

He argues that figuring out how to align the goals of a superintelligent AI with our goals isn’t just important, but also hard and continues to be an unsolved problem. For example, if I ask a self-driving car to take me to the airport as fast as possible and it takes my word for it, the next thing I know I am being chased by helicopters and I find myself covered in vomit. I could get mad at the car all day long and tell it ‘That’s not what I wanted!’, it can argue ‘That’s what you asked for.’"

    "title": "Goodhart’s Law - When Chasing Measures Goes Wrong",
    "section": "Sustainability Targets and Initiatives",
    "text": "Sustainability Targets and Initiatives\nLet’s take a look at another example of where Goodhart’s law maybe applicable - sustainability targets and initiatives.\nFollowing the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) in which stated that\n\n“Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic [human-caused] CO2 emissions and declining net non-CO2 radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal timescales.\n\nEver since then, there has been significant growth in the number of actors pledging net zero emissions. Many standards such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and International Sustainability Standards have emerged that interpret the net zero concept and aim to measure progress towards net zero targets. The rise of these standards have led to the (re)emergence of various policies and mechanisms such as carbon offsets.\nThe idea behind a carbon offset is that when an entity releases greenhouse gases, they can pay someone else to remove an equivalent amount of climate pollution from the atmosphere. For example, if an automotive manufacturer in a developed country that wants to claim it is reducing its emissions, the manufacturer can pay for a patch of rainforest to be protected in the Amazon that can absorb an equal amount of emissions. This in theory – cancels out - or offsets the impact of the automotive manufacturer emissions.\nOne can see the appeal for carbon offsets. For many industries, the cost of addressing their own emissions can be a huge undertaking. By directly funding offset projects, the cost of addressing climate change becomes more manageable. It sounds pretty straightforward, right?\nIt is all fun and games until you take a look at the reality.\nHow it started:\n\n\n\nSource: Marketplace.org\n\n\nHow it’s going:\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg.org\n\n\nCarbon offsets have been there since 1970s. So what went wrong along the way?\nKeeping aside the limitations of carbon offsets such as overstated baselines, double counting of emissions, additionality; one can see how Goodhart’s law might be at play here.\nConsider a simple example. A dairy farm wants to setup its operations in California. This means the dairy farm will have to clear 1 hectare of land to be up and running. Theoretically, the dairy farm could offset its impact by planting 1 hectare of vegetation in Amazon. Soon enough, this will prompt other dairy farms to do the same thing and before you know it hundreds of acres of lands have been cleared in California. But you might say : ‘Aren’t they making up for their impacts by offsetting their emissions in Amazon?’\nPartially yes. But 1 hectare of land in California is not the same as 1 hectare of land in Amazon. This has been one of the criticisms of carbon offsets where offset projects tend to encourage ‘business as usual’ practices without considering the ecological complexities of the different regions.\nThe organizations can claim to be carbon neutral (which on paper they might be). But in the end, are we really ‘solving’ for the underlying problem?"

    "section": "Biodiversity Conservation",
    "text": "Biodiversity Conservation\nSimilarly, Goodhart’s law finds it way in a related area - protecting biodiversity.\nRapid declines in populations of various vulnerable species have led to their inclusion in direct measures of biodiversity such as International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Red List Index (RLI). The Index is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™, which is widely considered to be the leading assessment of the extinction risk of species. The Red List involves the application of quantitative criteria based on population size, distribution area, and rate of decline, to assign species to different categories of relative extinction risk.\nAs a result, a substantial research effort has been devoted to examining the causes of decline in these vulnerable species. This has led to increases in conservation efforts which have had some success in slowing or even reversing the observed declines. At first glance, this can viewed as a success story. However, it has also potentially undermined the use of these species as a sustainability indicator. As policy and management interventions have focused specifically on vulnerable species, with the aim of improving this indicator, abundance of these species is arguably now less representative of the general state of the natural environment than it was hitherto. Consequently, any increase in the indicator is more likely to be a measure of specific response actions than of any general improvement in the state of the environment."

    "text": "Way Forward\nThese examples illustrate the central theme of Goodhart’s law, that is: once a measure is declared as important and policy aims to reduce it, the underlying correlation will be reduced.\nThis post is not meant to be a criticism of carbon offsets, sustainability standards or measures as a whole. As someone who is part of the ‘what gets measured, gets managed’ crowd, I still believe that measures still serve an important purpose.\nBut given what we know about Goodhart’s law, two key questions emerge:\n\nWhy does it happen?\nWhat can we do about it?\n\nIn the episode, Jeremie explains this happens because you end up baking in some misalignment between what you want and what the system wants. The more powerful that system becomes the the more it exploits that gap. People will tend to affect any given indicator/measure in whichever ways can be most readily achieved. As a result, indicators become decoupled from underlying process that they are supposed to indicate, and indicator values will become artificially inflated without addressing the underlying problem.\nThat takes care of the ‘why it happens’ part.

The whole episode had interesting tidbits that I really liked but for this post, I wanted to focus on just one segment - the economic principle of ‘Goodhart’s law’. They discuss it around 56:30:\nThis led me into a rabbit hole of Goodhart’s law and figuring out what it is all about. It can be traced back to 1975 when the British economist Charles Goodhart expressed this idea in his article “Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience”. In the article Goodhart explains:\nSimply put\nGoodhart’s law was originally developed in the context of conducting monetary policy on the basis of targets. However, its application can be observed in many other areas. Here are some other applications of Goodhart’s law that I can think at the top of my head:"

    "text": "My Fitness Journey\nAfter hearing about Goodhart’s law, it got me thinking about my own fitness journey. When I was just starting out, I used to get so fixated on the number on weighing scale because in my head I rationalized it as:\nLower weight on the weighing scale = Being closer to my fitness goals\nI became so obsessed with the number that I saw on the weighing scale everyday that I started ‘gaming’ the system. I started pulling off some shenanigans like being over zealous with my cardio, being extremely restrictive with my calories so that the next day the scale would read the number that I wanted to see. It got to a point where I lost track of my broader fitness goals and why I was doing it in the first place - to stay fit and be more healthy.\nIt wasn’t until many years later that I realized that I was doing it all wrong. It occurred me to that weight is one of the many metrics that can be used to gauge your progress. It can serve as a proxy for your fitness journey but it is not the end-all metric that is worth obsessing over. Not only that, but relying solely on a weight loss scale for fitness progress can be misleading. Turns out many variables affect your body weight, such as:\n\nSleep\nCarbohydrate intake\nSodium intake\nFiber\nMenstrual cycle\nFood volume\nConstipation\nStress\nHydration\n\nTherefore even if you are giving 100%, the numbers on weighing scale can fluctuate easily."

He argues that figuring out how to align the goals of a superintelligent AI with our goals isn’t just important, but also hard and continues to be an unsolved problem. For example, if I ask a self-driving car to take me to the airport as fast as possible and it literally takes my word for it, the next thing I know the car is ignoring the speed limits and all traffic signals, I am being chased by helicopters and by the time I arrive at the airport, I find myself covered in vomit. I could get mad at the car all day long and tell it ‘That’s not what I wanted!’, it can argue ‘That’s what you asked for.’"

    "section": "Sustainability Targets and Initiatives",
    "text": "Sustainability Targets and Initiatives\nLet’s take a look at another example of where Goodhart’s law maybe applicable - sustainability targets and initiatives.\nFollowing the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) which stated that\n\n“Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic [human-caused] CO2 emissions and declining net non-CO2radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal timescales.\n\nEver since then, there has been significant growth in the number of actors pledging net zero emissions. Many standards such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and International Sustainability Standards have emerged that interpret the net zero concept and aim to measure progress towards net zero targets. The rise of these standards have led to the (re)emergence of various policies and mechanisms such as carbon offsets.\nThe idea behind a carbon offset is that when an entity releases greenhouse gases, they can pay someone else to remove an equivalent amount of climate pollution from the atmosphere. For example, if an automotive manufacturer in a developed country that wants to claim it is reducing its emissions, the manufacturer can pay for a patch of rainforest to be protected in the Amazon that can absorb an equal amount of emissions. This in theory – cancels out - or offsets the impact of the automotive manufacturer’s emissions.\nOne can see the appeal for carbon offsets. For many industries, the cost of addressing their own emissions can be a huge undertaking. By directly funding offset projects, the cost of addressing climate change becomes more manageable. It sounds pretty straightforward, right?\nIt is all fun and games until you take a look at the reality.\nHow it started:\n\n\n\nSource: Marketplace.org\n\n\nHow it’s going:\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg.org\n\n\nCarbon offsets have been there since 1970s. So what went wrong along the way?\nKeeping aside the limitations of carbon offsets such as overstated baselines, double counting of emissions, additionality; one can see how Goodhart’s law might be at play here.\nConsider a simple example. A dairy farm wants to setup its operations in California. This means the dairy farm will have to clear 1 hectare of land to be up and running. Theoretically, the dairy farm could offset its impact by planting 1 hectare of vegetation in Amazon. Soon enough, this will prompt other dairy farms to do the same thing and before you know it hundreds of acres of lands have been cleared in California. But you might say : ‘Aren’t they making up for their impacts by offsetting their emissions in Amazon?’\nPartially yes. But 1 hectare of land in California is not the same as 1 hectare of land in Amazon. This has been one of the criticisms of carbon offsets where offset projects tend to encourage ‘business as usual’ practices without considering the ecological complexities of the different regions. As a result, organizations can claim to be carbon neutral (which on paper they might be). But in the end, are we really ‘solving’ for the underlying problem?"

    "section": "Biodiversity Conservation",
    "text": "Biodiversity Conservation\nSimilarly, Goodhart’s law finds it way in a related area - protecting biodiversity.\nRapid declines in populations of various vulnerable species have led to their inclusion in direct measures of biodiversity such as International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Red List Index (RLI). The Index is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™, which is widely considered to be the leading assessment of the extinction risk of species. The Red List involves the application of quantitative criteria based on population size, distribution area, and rate of decline, to assign species to different categories of relative extinction risk.\nA substantial research effort has been devoted to examining the causes of decline in these vulnerable species using the indicators used in RLI. This has led to increases in conservation efforts which have had some success in slowing or even reversing the observed declines. At first glance, this can viewed as a success story. However, it has also potentially undermined the use of these species as a sustainability indicator. As policy and management interventions have focused specifically on vulnerable species, with the aim of improving this indicator, abundance of these species is arguably now less representative of the general state of the natural environment than it was hitherto. Consequently, any increase in the indicator is more likely to be a measure of specific response actions than of any general improvement in the state of the environment."

    "text": "Way Forward\nThese examples illustrate the central theme of Goodhart’s law, that is\n\nOnce a measure is declared as important and policy aims to reduce it, the underlying correlation will be reduced.\n\nThis post is not meant to be a criticism of carbon offsets, sustainability standards or measures as a whole. As someone who is part of the ‘what gets measured, gets managed’ crowd, I still believe that measures serve an important purpose.\nBut given what we know about Goodhart’s law, two key questions emerge:\n\nWhy does it happen?\nWhat can we do about it?\n\nIn the episode, Jeremie explains this happens because you end up baking in some misalignment between what you want and what the system wants. The more powerful that system becomes the the more it exploits that gap. People will tend to affect any given indicator/measure in whichever ways can be most readily achieved. As a result, indicators become decoupled from underlying process that they are supposed to indicate, and indicator values will become artificially inflated without addressing the underlying problem.\nThat takes care of the ‘why’. Now how do we actually address it?\nBefore coming up with ways to quantify something, we should be really clear with what are we trying to solve for? Do I want to track my daily weight or do I want to be the healthiest version of myself? Do I want to offset my emissions or do I want to make sure the global ecosystems are protected?\nOnce we are clear on the problem we are trying to solve, we should then think of all the possible ways in which the given indicator/measure could be exploited/gamified. How could our measure of choice become decoupled from the underlying process?\nSometimes we won’t have clear answers to to these questions, especially when we are trying to solve a novel problem where there has been no precedence. However, considering some of the confounding variables at the onset of the process could help us ensure that our measures are aligned with what we are trying to solve for.\nFinally, systems should be put in place to prevent manipulation of the indicators and the assessments on which they are based, to ensure that the information they provide is objective and reliable. Using multiple indicator sets, including measures of pressure as well as state variables, could help reduce scope for indicator manipulation.\nIn conclusion, measures serve an important function in guiding decision-making and assessing progress toward goals. However, there is a need for caution in interpreting the information provided by any measure that are used; at best, they can only provide a partial indication of the status and trends of the process we are trying to assess, and this needs to be appreciated by the decision-makers who employ them."

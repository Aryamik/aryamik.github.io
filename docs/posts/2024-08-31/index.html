<p>If you guessed regulations, then you are right.</p>
<p>A while back, I came across this post on r/dundermifflin. Sometime later, a totally random thought came to my head: what would be the course that I took at UW that would be analogous to that meme format?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>For me, it would be ENBUS 408 – Best Practices in Regulation Instrument Choice in Environmental Policy.</p>
<p>(By the way if you are wondering which character in The Office had the most impact in the story given their limited screen time, I would go with Robert California. Period.)</p>
<p>I took ENBUS 408 during my last term at UW and the entire premise of that course was on designing ‘smart regulations’ when it comes to addressing environmental problems. Having been involved in this space that is constantly evolving, not a day goes by that I don’t see a new ESG regulation popping up in my newsfeed. Looking back, I can definitely say now that ENBUS 408 made me appreciate the process that goes behind designing regulations.</p>
<p>My last few posts have been focused on the idea of transparency around AI governance. As I was in the process of writing them, I realized that AI and sustainability share a lot of common features. The obvious one being that they are rapidly evolving. So I asked myself: Can we borrow a page from environmental policy making and design ‘smart regulations’ for AI? That’s what compelled me to write this post.</p>
<p>What are smart regulations in the first place?</p>
<p>This excerpt from Chapter 8 of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q1crtm">Regulatory Theory: Foundations and applications</a> by Peter Drahos sums up smart regulations pretty succinctly:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The term [smart regulation] refers to a form of regulatory pluralism that embraces flexible, imaginative and innovative forms of social control. In doing so, it harnesses governments as well as business and third parties. For example, it encompasses self-regulation and co-regulation, using commercial interests and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (such as peak bodies) as regulatory surrogates, together with improving the effectiveness and efficiency of more conventional forms of direct government regulation. The underlying rationale is that, in the majority of circumstances, the use of multiple rather than single policy instruments, and a broader range of regulatory actors, will produce better regulation. As such, it envisages the implementation of complementary combinations of instruments and participants tailored to meet the imperatives of specific environmental issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the article, the authors Neil Gunningham and Darren Sinclair argue that regulations were traditionally considered a bipartiate process involving the state (the regulator) and the business (the regulated entity). However, work by <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=R1ArEAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=joseph+rees&amp;ots=fPj33B0ouv&amp;sig=gvs25veBIQFHXMjhHB0LrBSOxyA&amp;redir_esc=y">Joseph Rees in 1988</a> highlighted that there are multiple actors influencing the behavior or regulated groups in a variety of complex and subtle ways. In an age when we are dealing with complex problems such as climate change and AI, smart regulations have emerged as an alternative where traditional command-and-control regulation nor the free market have been sufficient in addressing them. As a result, the focus of smart regulation is on understanding the dynamic interplay of different actors such as international standards organisations; trading partners and the supply chain; commercial institutions and financial markets; peer pressure and self-regulation through industry associations; and civil society.</p>
<p>The authors proposes the following ‘regulatory design principles’ that should guide these smart regulations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The desirability of preferring complementary instrument mixes over single instrument approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>The virtues of parsimony where less interventionist measures should be preferred.</p></li>
<li><p>The benefits of an escalating response up an instrument pyramid (utilizing not only government, but also business and third parties) to build in regulatory responsiveness, to increase dependability of outcomes through instrument sequencing and to provide early warning of instrument failure through the use of triggers.</p></li>
<li><p>Empowering third parties (both commercial and non-commercial) to act as surrogate regulators, thereby achieving not only better environmental outcomes at less cost but also freeing up scarce regulatory resources, which can be redeployed in circumstances where no alternatives to direct government intervention are available.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximising opportunities for win–win outcomes by expanding the boundaries within which such opportunities are available and encouraging business to go ‘beyond compliance’ within existing legal requirements.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The trick however is finding the right combinations of instruments that work together.</p>
<p>In the article ‘<a href="https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/PBRLit/GunninghamSinclair.pdf">Regulatory Pluralism: Designing Policy Mixes for Environmental Protection</a>’, the authors outlined some of the complementary instrument choices that I think can be leveraged for designing AI related regulations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Voluntarism and Command and Control Regulation: The combination of voluntarism (where individual firms voluntarily seek to improve an objective/target) and traditional command-and-control regulation where there is a clear definition of what is permitted and what is illegal. An example that I can think of is many organizations have been voluntarily reporting on their climate-related disclosures using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability standards in the early 2000s, long before some of the regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into effect where there are clear requirements for organizations on these disclosures.</p>
<p>An argument can be made that if voluntarism were introduced alone, the outcomes (in this case, transparent disclosures) would had been sub-optimal and it would had resulted in an increased greenwashing risk. However, the combination of command and control regulations with voluntary standards encourages firms to go <em>beyond compliance</em> while still complying with the performance baseline.</p>
<p>In one of my previous <a href="https://aryamik.github.io/posts/2024-08-04/">posts</a>, I talked about ‘AI Washing’ and how there is a growing movement to open source AI governance. A regulation that combines mandatory requirements such as disclosures of data sources and decision making processes in the AI systems used by organizations along with voluntary initiatives where organizations are encouraged to adopt best practices for AI transparency and fairness. In a way, firms choosing to voluntary adopt these best practices allows this industry to self regulate.</p></li>
<li><p>Command and Control Regulation and Supply-Side Incentives:</p>
<p>Supply-side incentives in this context refer to tax concessions or soft loans for achieving specific outcomes. For instance, organizations that meet or exceed the regulatory standards, could be offered grants and tax credits which would encourage them to invest in research initiatives on improving accuracy, transparency and reducing biases of AI systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Command and Control Regulation and Broad-Based Economic Incentives</p>
<p>Besides supply-side incentives, command and control regulations could be paired with broader economic incentives in cases when hey are used to target different aspects of a common problem. For example, a regulatory body might impose strict guidelines on AI developers requiring transparency in how algorithms are trained and tested for bias. This might require that organizations to undergo fairness audits and provide detailed reports on the data used and the results of bias evaluations. Failure to meet certain standards would result in penalties.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, some instrument choices might be inherently incompatible. For example, mandating specific AI technologies (command-and-control) for firms in tandem with a tax-based incentive for using a specific technology (economic instruments) might be counterproductive. This is largely because command-and-control regulations seek to impose predetermined outcomes outcomes on industry which means individual firms are largely limited in what they can and cannot do. Economic instruments, on the other hand, seek to maximize the flexibility of firms in their ability to choose the optimal course of action as long as it meets the price signal relative to the level of outcome desired.</p>
<p>Similarly, self regulation when combined together with broad-based economic instruments might be an overkill. For example, If an industry code sets rigid data privacy requirements for AI systems across all sectors, it could undermine the effectiveness of the tax penalties where organizations that do not meet the privacy standards. The tax might be less effective in driving firms with higher abatement costs to comply with privacy standards since the self-regulation approach imposes uniform requirements, not considering these cost differences. As a result, the tax may fail to achieve its intended goal of encouraging privacy improvements across the industry.</p>
<p>To overcome the drawbacks that may arise from combining instruments, the authors recommend sequencing their introduction, which means certain instruments should be held in reserve and should only be applied if and when other instruments demonstrably fail to meet pre- determined performance benchmarks. It could be as simple as introductng an entirely new instrument category introduced where previous categories have failed or enforcing elements of a pre-existing instrument to supplement the shortcomings of another. Sequencing ensures that there is a progression when it comes to levels of intervention.</p>
<p>A couple of caveats that I want to mention briefly. Some <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2230.2008.00681.x">authors</a> authors claim that smart regulations do not address institutional issues, compliance-type specific responses, performance sensitivity and adaptability of regulatory regimes (Baldwin and Black 2008; Böcher and Toller 2003). Additionally, when discussing how to best regulate AI, it’s important to highlight that it goes far beyond mere technical oversight. Effective regulation must tackle deeply embedded issues such as bias, discrimination, and ethics; something that I did not talk about.</p>
<p>Are smart regulations the panacea for all the problems? I don’t think so. However, they can be a valuable component of a broader regulatory strategy when it comes to AI governance.</p>

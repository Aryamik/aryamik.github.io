# Welcome to my website!

I am a recent graduate of the Environment and Business program with a minor in Economics from the University of Waterloo.

As an aspiring sustainability professional, I enjoy connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in ESG, data analytics, and statistics.

My passion lies in exploring the connection between financial sector players and the link between sustainability and financial performance of enterprises. I excel when working in collaborative groups to solve real-world business problems and am eager to adapt and learn in different environments.

When I am not in the office I love playing my bass guitar and pursuing my fitness goals! Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.aryamik.sharma@uwaterloo.ca) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.

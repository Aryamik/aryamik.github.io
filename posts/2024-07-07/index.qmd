I was listening to [Episode #2156 of the Joe Rogan
Experience](https://youtu.be/c6JdeL90ans) featuring Jeremie & Edouard
Harris from Gladstone AI, an organization dedicated to promoting the
responsible development and adoption of AI. The whole episode had
interesting tidbits that I really liked but for this post, I wanted to
focus on just one segment - the economic principle of 'Goodhart's law'.
They discuss it around 56:30:

> *This economic principle called Goodhart's Law where the minute you
> take a metric you were using to measure something. So you're saying, I
> don't know, GDP is a great measure of how happy we are in the United
> States. Let's say it was. Sounds reasonable. The moment you turn that
> metric into a target that you're going to reward people for optimizing
> it stops measuring the thing it was measuring before. It stops being a
> good measure of the thing you cared about because people will come up
> with dangerously creative hacks, gaming the system, finding ways to
> make that number go up that don't map on to the intent that you had
> going in.*

This led me into a rabbit hole of Goodhart's law and figuring out what
it is all about. It can be traced back to 1975 when the British
economist Charles Goodhart expressed this idea in his article ["Problems
of Monetary Management: The U.K.
Experience"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-17295-5_4).
In the article Goodhart explains:

> *Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once
> pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.*

Simply put

> *When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.*

Goodhart's law was originally developed in the context of conducting
monetary policy on the basis of targets. However, its application can be
observed in many other areas. Here are some other applications of
Goodhart's law that I can think at the top of my head:

## My Fitness Journey

After hearing about Goodhart's law, it got me thinking about my own
fitness journey. When I was just starting out, I used to get so fixated
on the number on weighing scale because in my head I rationalized it as:

*Lower weight on the weighing scale = Being closer to my fitness goals*

I became so obsessed with the number that I saw on the weighing scale
everyday that I started 'gaming' the system. I started pulling off some
shenanigans like being over zealous with my cardio, being extremely
restrictive with my calories so that the next day the scale would read
the number that I wanted to see. It got to a point where I lost track of
my broader fitness goals and why I was doing it in the first place - to
stay fit and be more healthy.

It wasn't until many years later that I realized that I was doing it all
wrong. It occurred me to that weight is one of the many metrics that can
be used to gauge your progress. It can serve as a proxy for your fitness
journey but it is not the end-all metric that is worth obsessing over.
Not only that, but relying solely on a weight loss scale for fitness
progress can be misleading. Turns out [many variables affect your body
weight](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/why-arent-your-results-good-enough),
such as:

-   Sleep

-   Carbohydrate intake

-   Sodium intake

-   Fiber

-   Menstrual cycle

-   Food volume

-   Constipation

-   Stress

-   Hydration

Therefore even if you are giving 100%, the numbers on weighing scale can
fluctuate easily.

## AI Goals

In Life 3.0 (which is easily one of my favorite books of all time), Max
Tegmark mentions that in our quest to building Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) as we get more intelligent and powerful machines, it
will become paramount to ensure that their goals are aligned with ours.
He argues that figuring out how to align the goals of a superintelligent
AI with our goals isn't just important, but also hard and continues to
be an unsolved problem. For example, if I ask a self-driving car to take
me to the airport as fast as possible and it literally takes my word for
it, the next thing I know the car is ignoring the speed limits and all
traffic signals, I am being chased by helicopters and by the time I
arrive at the airport, I find myself covered in vomit. I could get mad
at the car all day long and tell it 'That's not what I wanted!', it can
argue 'That's what you asked for.'

## Sustainability Targets and Initiatives

Let's take a look at another example of where Goodhart's law maybe
applicable - sustainability targets and initiatives.

Following the Paris Agreement, the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change")
published its [Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C
(SR15)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Report_on_Global_Warming_of_1.5_%C2%B0C "Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C")
which stated that

> *"Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic
> \[human-caused\] CO~2~ emissions and declining net non-CO~2~[radiative
> forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing "Radiative forcing")
> would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal timescales.*

Ever since then, there has been significant growth in the number of
actors pledging net zero emissions. Many standards such as the [Science
Based Targets
initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Based_Targets_initiative "Science Based Targets initiative")
(SBTi) and [International Sustainability
Standards](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-sustainability-standards-board/)
have emerged that interpret the net zero concept and aim to measure
progress towards net zero targets. The rise of these standards have led
to the (re)emergence of various policies and mechanisms such as carbon
offsets.

The idea behind a carbon offset is that when an entity releases
greenhouse gases, they can pay someone else to remove an equivalent
amount of climate pollution from the atmosphere. For example, if an
automotive manufacturer in a developed country that wants to claim it is
reducing its emissions, the manufacturer can pay for a patch of
rainforest to be protected in the Amazon that can absorb an equal amount
of emissions. This in theory -- cancels out - or offsets the impact of
the automotive manufacturer's emissions.

One can see the appeal for carbon offsets. For many industries, the cost
of addressing their own emissions can be a huge undertaking. By directly
funding offset projects, the cost of addressing climate change becomes
more manageable. It sounds pretty straightforward, right?

It is all fun and games until you take a look at the reality.

How it started:

How it's going:

Carbon offsets have been there since
[1970s](https://ghginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditionalityPaper_Part-1ver3FINAL.pdf).
So what went wrong along the way?

Keeping aside the [limitations of carbon
offsets](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.ade3535) such
as overstated baselines, double counting of emissions, additionality;
one can see how Goodhart's law might be at play here.

Consider a simple example. A dairy farm wants to setup its operations in
California. This means the dairy farm will have to clear 1 hectare of
land to be up and running. Theoretically, the dairy farm could offset
its impact by planting 1 hectare of vegetation in Amazon. Soon enough,
this will prompt other dairy farms to do the same thing and before you
know it hundreds of acres of lands have been cleared in California. But
you might say : 'Aren't they making up for their impacts by offsetting
their emissions in Amazon?'

Partially yes. But 1 hectare of land in California is not the same as 1
hectare of land in Amazon. This has been [one of the
criticisms](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe)
of carbon offsets where offset projects tend to encourage 'business as
usual' practices without considering the ecological complexities of the
different regions. As a result, organizations can claim to be carbon
neutral (which on paper they might be). But in the end, are we really
'solving' for the underlying problem?

## Biodiversity Conservation

Similarly, Goodhart's law finds it way in a related area - protecting
biodiversity.

Rapid declines in populations of various vulnerable species have led to
their inclusion in direct measures of biodiversity such as
[International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN)](https://www.iucn.org/), Red List Index (RLI). The Index is based
on the [IUCN Red List of Threatened
Species™](https://www.iucnredlist.org/about/background-history), which
is widely considered to be the leading assessment of the extinction risk
of species. The Red List involves the [application of quantitative
criteria](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/summary-sheet) based on
population size, distribution area, and rate of decline, to assign
species to different categories of relative extinction risk.

A substantial research effort has been devoted to examining the causes
of decline in these vulnerable species using the indicators used in RLI.
This [has led to increases in conservation
efforts](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14749730110100778)
which have had some success in slowing or even reversing the observed
declines. At first glance, this can viewed as a success story. However,
it has also potentially undermined the use of these species as a
sustainability indicator. As policy and management interventions have
focused specifically on vulnerable species, with the aim of improving
this indicator, [abundance of these species is arguably now less
representative of the general state of the natural environment than it
was
hitherto.](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2011.00167.x)
Consequently, any increase in the indicator is more likely to be a
measure of specific response actions than of any general improvement in
the state of the environment.

## Way Forward

These examples illustrate the central theme of Goodhart's law, that is

> Once a measure is declared as important and policy aims to reduce it,
> the underlying correlation will be reduced.

This post is not meant to be a criticism of carbon offsets,
sustainability standards or measures as a whole. As someone who is part
of the 'what gets measured, gets managed' crowd, I still believe that
measures serve an important purpose.

But given what we know about Goodhart's law, two key questions emerge:

-   Why does it happen?

-   What can we do about it?

In the episode, Jeremie explains this happens because you end up baking
in some misalignment between what you want and what the system wants.
The more powerful that system becomes the the more it exploits that gap.
People will tend to affect any given indicator/measure in whichever ways
can be most readily achieved. As a result, indicators become decoupled
from underlying process that they are supposed to indicate, and
indicator values will become artificially inflated without addressing
the underlying problem.

That takes care of the 'why'. Now how do we actually address it?

Before coming up with ways to quantify something, we should be really
clear with *what are we trying to solve for?* Do I want to track my
daily weight or do I want to be the healthiest version of myself? Do I
want to offset my emissions or do I want to make sure the global
ecosystems are protected?

Once we are clear on the problem we are trying to solve, we should then
think of all the possible ways in which the given indicator/measure
could be exploited/gamified. How could our measure of choice become
decoupled from the underlying process?

Sometimes we won't have clear answers to to these questions, especially
when we are trying to solve a novel problem where there has been no
precedence. However, considering some of the confounding variables at
the onset of the process could help us ensure that our measures are
aligned with what we are trying to solve for.

Finally, systems should be put in place to prevent manipulation of the
indicators and the assessments on which they are based, to ensure that
the information they provide is objective and reliable. Using multiple
indicator sets, including measures of pressure as well as state
variables, could help reduce scope for indicator manipulation.

In conclusion, measures serve an important function in guiding
decision-making and assessing progress toward goals. However, there is a
need for caution in interpreting the information provided by any measure
that are used; at best, they can only provide a partial indication of
the status and trends of the process we are trying to assess, and this
needs to be appreciated by the decision-makers who employ them.

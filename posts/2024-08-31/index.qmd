Riddle me this:

If you guessed regulations, then you are right.

A while back, I came across this post on r/dundermifflin. Sometime
later, a totally random thought came to my head: what would be the
course that I took at UW that would be analogous to that meme format?

[![](images/who-is-this-in-the-office-v0-vffle08dwcec1.webp)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/19ed6m9/who_is_this_in_the_office/?share_id=NKnR1gA7iuxQv6NGjbdCS)

For me, it would be ENBUS 408 â€“ Best Practices in Regulation Instrument
Choice in Environmental Policy.

(By the way if you are wondering which character in The Office had the
most impact in the story given their limited screen time, I would go
with Robert California. Period.)

I took ENBUS 408 during my last term at UW and the entire premise of
that course was on designing 'smart regulations' when it comes to
addressing environmental problems. Having been involved in this space
that is constantly evolving, not a day goes by that I don't see a new
ESG regulation popping up in my newsfeed. Looking back, I can definitely
say now that ENBUS 408 made me appreciate the process that goes behind
designing regulations.

My last few posts have been focused on the idea of transparency around
AI governance. As I was in the process of writing them, I realized that
AI and sustainability share a lot of common features. The obvious one
being that they are rapidly evolving. So I asked myself: Can we borrow a
page from environmental policy making and design 'smart regulations' for
AI? That's what compelled me to write this post.

What are smart regulations in the first place?

This excerpt from Chapter 8 of [Regulatory Theory: Foundations and
applications](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1q1crtm) by Peter Drahos
sums up smart regulations pretty succinctly:

> The term \[smart regulation\] refers to a form of regulatory pluralism
> that embraces flexible, imaginative and innovative forms of social
> control. In doing so, it harnesses governments as well as business and
> third parties. For example, it encompasses self-regulation and
> co-regulation, using commercial interests and non-governmental
> organisations (NGOs) (such as peak bodies) as regulatory surrogates,
> together with improving the effectiveness and efficiency of more
> conventional forms of direct government regulation. The underlying
> rationale is that, in the majority of circumstances, the use of
> multiple rather than single policy instruments, and a broader range of
> regulatory actors, will produce better regulation. As such, it
> envisages the implementation of complementary combinations of
> instruments and participants tailored to meet the imperatives of
> specific environmental issues.

In the article, the authors Neil Gunningham and Darren Sinclair argue
that regulations were traditionally considered a bipartiate process
involving the state (the regulator) and the business (the regulated
entity). However, work by [Joseph Rees in
1988](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=R1ArEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=joseph+rees&ots=fPj33B0ouv&sig=gvs25veBIQFHXMjhHB0LrBSOxyA&redir_esc=y)
highlighted that there are multiple actors influencing the behavior or
regulated groups in a variety of complex and subtle ways. In an age when
we are dealing with complex problems such as climate change and AI,
smart regulations have emerged as an alternative where traditional
command-and-control regulation nor the free market have been sufficient
in addressing them. As a result, the focus of smart regulation is on
understanding the dynamic interplay of different actors such as
international standards organisations; trading partners and the supply
chain; commercial institutions and financial markets; peer pressure and
self-regulation through industry associations; and civil society.

The authors proposes the following 'regulatory design principles' that
should guide these smart regulations:

-   The desirability of preferring complementary instrument mixes over
    single instrument approaches.

-   The virtues of parsimony where less interventionist measures should
    be preferred.

-   The benefits of an escalating response up an instrument pyramid
    (utilizing not only government, but also business and third parties)
    to build in regulatory responsiveness, to increase dependability of
    outcomes through instrument sequencing and to provide early warning
    of instrument failure through the use of triggers.

-   Empowering third parties (both commercial and non-commercial) to act
    as surrogate regulators, thereby achieving not only better
    environmental outcomes at less cost but also freeing up scarce
    regulatory resources, which can be redeployed in circumstances where
    no alternatives to direct government intervention are available.

-   Maximising opportunities for win--win outcomes by expanding the
    boundaries within which such opportunities are available and
    encouraging business to go 'beyond compliance' within existing legal
    requirements.

The trick however is finding the right combinations of instruments that
work together.

In the article '[Regulatory Pluralism: Designing Policy Mixes for
Environmental
Protection](https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/PBRLit/GunninghamSinclair.pdf)',
the authors outlined some of the complementary instrument choices that I
think can be leveraged for designing AI related regulations.

1.  Voluntarism and Command and Control Regulation: The combination of
    voluntarism (where individual firms voluntarily seek to improve an
    objective/target) and traditional command-and-control regulation
    where there is a clear definition of what is permitted and what is
    illegal. An example that I can think of is many organizations have
    been voluntarily reporting on their climate-related disclosures
    using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability standards
    in the early 2000s, long before some of the regulations such as the
    Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into effect
    where there are clear requirements for organizations on these
    disclosures.

    An argument can be made that if voluntarism were introduced alone,
    the outcomes (in this case, transparent disclosures) would had been
    sub-optimal and it would had resulted in an increased greenwashing
    risk. However, the combination of command and control regulations
    with voluntary standards encourages firms to go *beyond compliance*
    while still complying with the performance baseline.

    In one of my previous
    [posts](https://aryamik.github.io/posts/2024-08-04/), I talked about
    'AI Washing' and how there is a growing movement to open source AI
    governance. A regulation that combines mandatory requirements such
    as disclosures of data sources and decision making processes in the
    AI systems used by organizations along with voluntary initiatives
    where organizations are encouraged to adopt best practices for AI
    transparency and fairness. In a way, firms choosing to voluntary
    adopt these best practices allows this industry to self regulate.

2.  Command and Control Regulation and Supply-Side Incentives:

    Supply-side incentives in this context refer to tax concessions or
    soft loans for achieving specific outcomes. For instance,
    organizations that meet or exceed the regulatory standards, could be
    offered grants and tax credits which would encourage them to invest
    in research initiatives on improving accuracy, transparency and
    reducing biases of AI systems.

3.  Command and Control Regulation and Broad-Based Economic Incentives

    Besides supply-side incentives, command and control regulations
    could be paired with broader economic incentives in cases when hey
    are used to target different aspects of a common problem. For
    example, a regulatory body might impose strict guidelines on AI
    developers requiring transparency in how algorithms are trained and
    tested for bias. This might require that organizations to undergo
    fairness audits and provide detailed reports on the data used and
    the results of bias evaluations. Failure to meet certain standards
    would result in penalties.

On the other hand, some instrument choices might be inherently
incompatible. For example, mandating specific AI technologies
(command-and-control) for firms in tandem with a tax-based incentive for
using a specific technology (economic instruments) might be
counterproductive. This is largely because command-and-control
regulations seek to impose predetermined outcomes outcomes on industry
which means individual firms are largely limited in what they can and
cannot do. Economic instruments, on the other hand, seek to maximize the
flexibility of firms in their ability to choose the optimal course of
action as long as it meets the price signal relative to the level of
outcome desired.

Similarly, self regulation when combined together with broad-based
economic instruments might be an overkill. For example, If an industry
code sets rigid data privacy requirements for AI systems across all
sectors, it could undermine the effectiveness of the tax penalties where
organizations that do not meet the privacy standards. The tax might be
less effective in driving firms with higher abatement costs to comply
with privacy standards since the self-regulation approach imposes
uniform requirements, not considering these cost differences. As a
result, the tax may fail to achieve its intended goal of encouraging
privacy improvements across the industry.

To overcome the drawbacks that may arise from combining instruments, the
authors recommend sequencing their introduction, which means certain
instruments should be held in reserve and should only be applied if and
when other instruments demonstrably fail to meet pre- determined
performance benchmarks. It could be as simple as introductng an entirely
new instrument category introduced where previous categories have failed
or enforcing elements of a pre-existing instrument to supplement the
shortcomings of another. Sequencing ensures that there is a progression
when it comes to levels of intervention.

A couple of caveats that I want to mention briefly. Some
[authors](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2230.2008.00681.x)
authors claim that smart regulations do not address institutional
issues, compliance-type specific responses, performance sensitivity and
adaptability of regulatory regimes (Baldwin and Black 2008; BÃ¶cher and
Toller 2003). Additionally, when discussing how to best regulate AI,
it's important to highlight that it goes far beyond mere technical
oversight. Effective regulation must tackle deeply embedded issues such
as bias, discrimination, and ethics; something that I did not talk
about.

Are smart regulations the panacea for all the problems? I don't think
so. However, they can be a valuable component of a broader regulatory
strategy when it comes to AI governance.

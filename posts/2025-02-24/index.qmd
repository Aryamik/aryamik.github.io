Riddle me this:

I can't be bought, nor can I be sold,\
I‚Äôm found in moments, both young and old.\
I grow when shared, but shrink when hoarded,\
I bring warmth when your heart‚Äôs unguarded.\
What am I?

If you guessed happiness, you are right. To be fair, the first line
('can't be bought') gave it away. But in any event, ask any random
person walking on the street what do they want in life, almost all of
them would want something that directly or indirectly leads to
happiness.

But what if I told you nature may have a role in our pursuit of
happiness? Ok hear me out.

Right from when we were kids, we were taught that nature has a value in
itself. It provides us with so many resources that we need for our
survival. When we think of these resources, we typically think of the
'material' stuff like oxygen, food, water, fuel and so on. Something
that we tend to lose sight of is the *aesthetic* stuff.

In ENVS 195, I remember learning about various 'Environmental Value
Systems' where we talked about nature has an instrumental value, which
means that being in or seeing nature provides people with pleasure.
Lately, researchers have been trying to decipher this instrumental value
and work is being done to show that nature may have role in our overall
well being.

I recently finished reading *Phosphorescence: A Memoir of Finding Joy
When Your World Goes Dark by Julia Baird*. As the title suggests, the
premise of the book is how can we become phosphorescent, that is radiate
happiness when the world seems to have gone dark. What piqued my
interest was the role of nature in finding 'awe'. Baird talks about that
extensively in the chapter 'Nature Deficit Disorder: On Biophilia'.

Before I dive into the nitty gritties, I wanted to take a step back and
talk a little bit about 'awe'.

What is awe?

Simply put, it is something that makes us go '*WOAH'* or 'WOW'. (if you
heard those words in voice of Owen Wilson, then you know exactly what I
am talking about!)

Basically this emojiüòÆwhich according to
[Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-open-mouth)

> A yellow face with small,¬†open eyes and a large, round mouth,
> slack¬†with¬†surprise or shock, as if saying *Wow!* or *Oh my!* May
> convey such feelings as awe¬†or disbelief, often milder or more ironic
> in tone¬†than [üò±¬†Face Screaming
> in¬†Fear](https://emojipedia.org/face-screaming-in-fear/).

Awe is having a resurgence in the scientific community. I was listening
to Dr. Dr. Laurie Santos talk about it in a [recent
episode](https://youtu.be/Phm-Alz1Zjo?t=9873) of Huberman Lab.

You see where I am going with this?

Going back to *Phosphorescence*, Julia Baird talks about 'nature deficit
disorder' , a term that was coined by American writer Richard Louv in
his book Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature
Deficit Disorder.

She then references some interesting studies that are being conducted on
this topic.

-   A study by [Engemann et al.
    (2019)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1807504116) found that
    green space can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower
    risk of psychiatric disorders. This nation-wide study covering
    \>900,000 people shows that children who grew up with the lowest
    levels of green space had up to 55% higher risk of developing a
    psychiatric disorder independent from effects of other known risk
    factors.

-   [Martin et al.
    (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1353829218308451?via%3Dihub)
    found that being able to see green spaces from your home is
    associated with reduced cravings for alcohol, cigarettes and harmful
    foods.

-   Work by [Frances E.
    Kuo](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00139160121972846)
    found that green space enhances residents‚Äô effectiveness by reducing
    mental fatigue.

-   [Roger S.
    Ulrich](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.6143402)
    found that twenty-three surgical patients assigned to rooms with
    windows looking out on a natural scene had shorter postoperative
    hospital stays, received fewer negative evaluative comments in
    nurses' notes, and took fewer potent analgesics than 23 matched
    patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick building wall.

-   [Omid Kardan et al.
    (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11610#Sec8) ran a study
    in urban areas in Toronto and found that found that having ten or
    more trees in a city block ‚Äúimproves health perception in a way that
    is like an increase in annual personal salary of \$10,000.‚Äù Even
    better, ‚Äúhaving eleven more trees in a city block decreased
    cardio-metabolic conditions in ways compared to an increase in an
    annual personal income of \$20,000.‚Äù

-   [Song et al. (2016)](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/13/8/781) found
    positive physiological relaxation effects of nature therapy on
    activities of the central nervous system, autonomic nervous system,
    endocrine system and immune system.

-   A 2016 study by [Daniel Nutsford et al.
    (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1353829216300119)
    found that residential exposure to visible blue space (but not green
    space) was associated with lower psychological distress in
    Wellington, New Zealand.

These were just some of the studies I found interesting. If you were to
type in "Nature" and "Well Being" in Google Scholar, I am sure you will
plenty of other interesting work that has been done. Granted these
studies have their own limitations and further research is needed but
the message that sticks out to me is that there is 'something valuable'
that nature provides us. Or as Florence Williams, author of the book
'The Nature Fix', eloquently puts it ‚ÄúThe more nature, the better you
feel".

When I take a step back and think about these studies as well as what
Dr. Laurie Santos has to say about 'awe'. I may have a simple theory
that connects nature, awe and our overall well being.

Humans are social animals. We always have and always will be. Years of
urbanization and modern life have made us more isolated. The more
isolated we become from our tribe, the more depressed we feel. Remember
what Dr. Santos mentioned a key feature of awe?

"This sense of oh my gosh that is amazing, there's something bigger than
me."

Nature simply invokes the feeling of awe and makes us realize that we
are part of something bigger. And it is not that awe is just restricted
to natural settings. Even though I haven't been to Egypt, simply
learning more about the masterful craftsmanship that went behind the
Great Pyramid of Giza made me go "woah, how did they do that?". It is
just that nature is readily available to us. Now the unfortunate reality
is nature is rapidly disappearing right before our eyes. Maybe this
should be a cause for concern. Yes, we will lose access to a variety of
ecosystem services but we will also be depriving the society of these
small moments to find awe and happiness.

When I think about the most profound experiences in my life, I am
instantly reminded when I was out on trip with my buddies in Lansdowne,
Uttarakhand in January 2021. I remember, one the last night of our trip,
we were all busy having a good time on the rooftops of our hotel. And it
was a perfect starry night. It was so perfect that we just sat there for
hours, and were starstruck at what we were all seeing.

I will let you be the judge of it.

Years of light pollution and living in 400 AQI air in New Delhi had made
us lose sight of something that is literally right above every single
night. It's part of the reason why one of my bucket list items is to
observe the white 'streak' of Milky Way you get to witness at Keck
observatory in Hawaii or Grand Canyon.

Am I saying awe is a cure to all mankind's problems? No. But I do
believe that simply finding these moments of awe in our lives will make
us realize that we are all somehow interconnected and are part of this
'tiny blue dot' that brings meaning to an otherwise meaningless
universe. As Brian Cox puts it, this fact alone should compel us to
think how we should behave towards others.

Hope you have an 'awe'-some week ahead!

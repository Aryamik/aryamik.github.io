The other day I was scrolling Reddit and saw a post that went something along the lines of 'AI induced brain rot is real' (ironic, considering Reddit is one of the leading contributors of brain rot).

If you don't know what that term means, [brain rot](https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024/) is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”. Fun fact - brain rot was named as the Oxford Word of the Year in 2024.

That post linked to this study that has been making headwinds - [Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872). Some key findings were:\

-   Memory Impact: 83% of participants using ChatGPT for writing tasks couldn't recall what they wrote moments later, versus only 11% who relied on traditional methods.

-   Brain Connectivity Decline: Regular ChatGPT users experienced a shocking 47% drop in neural connectivity, essentially halving their cognitive engagement.

-   Cognitive Debt: Continuous AI reliance might lead to diminished brain functionality, leaving users struggling when forced to think independently.

Immediately, there was a flurry of media articles larping on the "AI bad" narrative and how it's making us 'lazier'. I was like "Aw geez, here we go again."

Let me preface by saying I am not downplaying the negative impacts of AI. And this is by no means a criticism of this amazing study done by Kosmyna and colleagues. In fact, you will see why we need more studies like these to better understand the impacts of technological advancements on our overall wellbeing. [Jonathan Haidt](https://jonathanhaidt.com/social-media/) has been sounding the alarm on the negative impacts of social media on our mental health for over a decade and I fully support his views on this topic.

It's just that whenever there is a new technological innovation, there is this sort of kneejerk reaction without looking at it objectively. Don't believe me? Let's take a trip down the memory lane and revisit some of the examples.

Remember the 'Video Games are making you dumber' era? As a Gen Z, I remember that distinctly. In fact, I still think that sentiment is present today, it's just that it has been dwarfed by the 'Skibbidi-Tiktok-Reels-Brainrot' era.

![Replace video games with \[X\] technology and this reaction is still appropriate](images/clipboard-362949708.png)

Yes, playing video games can be addictive and can certainly have negative impacts on our overall wellbeing. But did you know surgeons who play video games for three hours per week. tend to [make fewer errors and perform tasks faster during laparoscopic surgery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17309970/)? Or how about the fact that video games can [improve balance, flexibility, braking force, lower-limb muscle strength, maximal oxygen levels, and heart rate](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691619863807)? [Or the fact that video games, when played in moderation, can result in increased empathy and prosocial behaviour](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563216303892)?

Similarly, you may have heard how our attention spans have greatly been diminished thanks to smartphones. A couple of decades ago, we had an excellent memory and ability to recall stuff. Before smartphones, we had to remember phone numbers in our heads. Now I can barely remember more than 5 numbers.

I agree being reliant on our smartphones to look up information at a moment's notice has eliminated the need to remember everything and it certainly had an impact on our diminished attention spans. But then I ask myself - "how does remembering 39 phone numbers help me in my day-to-day life?" Unless I am participating in a 'Phone Number Recall Competition', I don't see how remembering phone numbers (outside my emergency contacts) is serving me any utility? If anything, it is literally occupying my mental bandwidth which could be freed up on something else. I would even go on a limb to say trying to remember phone numbers just for the sake of remembering them seems egoistic to me. And this is exactly what I talked about in one of my previous [posts](https://aryamik.github.io/posts/2025-04-12/) that gets associated with the 'laziness' argument.

Same logic can be applied to the 'navigation apps have made us lose all sense of directions' argument. Before these apps took over, we had to memorize directions. Now Google Maps plans the trip for me. Sure I may have lost my sense of directions. But you know what? Google Maps does an amazing job of rerouting whenever I am stuck in traffic. Or how about the traffic alerts so that I know which roads to avoid in peak rush hour? I don't see any downsides with that.

My point is if we look at these examples objectively, there is nothing inherently 'positive' or 'negative' about them. Sure everything has its pros and cons in certain contexts. But who gets to decide what is a pro and what is a con? Short answer is we can't. It's akin to comparing apples and oranges. For every con, someone can counter that with a perfectly rational pro and before we know it we are stuck in this never ending cat and mouse chase where we have to win by any means necessary.

We could keep doing that or we could take a more pragmatic approach.

This requires us to start from a place of objectivity and being open to letting go of our preconceived notions about how things should be.

We need to understand that technological innovations are tools that are meant to carry out a particular function. It can be used for the good of mankind or it can be used for nefarious purposes. I can use a hammer to mount a painting or to break something. That does not make the hammer inherently 'good' or 'bad' and I don't see how it is going to be any different for AI. Not only that, but how can we make bold predictions on the impacts (positive and negative) of something when we don't even know what it is capable of?

For example, let's pick ChatGPT and how we are using it for everything under the sun; from drafting emails to summarizing 3 hour lectures on Youtube. Instead of letting our emotions cloud our judgments, let's start with examining what is really happening and asking questions such as:

-   "How is this different from what we have been doing?

-   "Where could this be beneficial? Let's do some studies on this."

-   "Where could this be harmful? We need to investigate any negative repercussions of this. "

-   "What do we need to do about it right now?"

-   "Is this how things are supposed to be as part of anthropocentric evolution?

This brings me to my next point - values. Instead of having these kneejerk reactions after every X amount of years whenever there is a technological revolution, how about we prioritize defining our values and then using those values to set our goals?

Ultimately we should be asking ourselves: "What do we value the most?"

"Do we value effective communication?" or "Do we value being fluent writers?"

"Do we value creativity?" or "Do we value getting the job done as quickly as possible?"

We can value multiple things at the same time. However, we should also be cognizant of the fact that some of the values will contradict others. That is in essence a key part of our society, we all value different things. Trying to come up with a 'universal value system' that fits the needs of 8 billion people has been THE CHALLENGE we have been trying to address since the dawn of civilization. Over time, our values will change. And that's perfectly fine! It's just that our subsequent goals and actions should evolve as well.

So that was my long winded way of saying "Let's be objective, guys". Instead of coming up with extreme narratives, how about we prioritize balanced perspectives? Is that too much to ask? Brain rot maybe real but fixing it requires us to look inwards and ask ourselves "why do we need to fix it?"

What if I told you wolf reintroductions would be one of the the most
polarizing topics in modern times? Sounds crazy and I wouldn't believe
it either. That was until I recently finished reading Diane K Boyd's
memoir *A Woman Among Wolves* and her work on wolf recovery.

Reading her work gave me a new found appreciation for wolves and more
importantly the work that goes behind in managing them.

As someone who considers himself as a 'wildlife enthusiast' and has no
dog in this fight (pun intended), it's just curious to see something as
simple as wolves being a controversial topic. The closest thing I have
had to a wolf encounter is one of our family dogs back home *Champa.*
One quick look at her pristine coat and her sharp, elongated snout and
it doesn't take an expert ecologist to figure out she is related to
wolves.

But based on my preliminary understanding of this topic, I will try my
best to narrow it down.

The wolf reintroduction debate is split into two. There is the pro-wolf
sentiment which calls for reintroudcting wolves to manage ecosystems.

And then on the other side of aisle there is a camp that is opposed to
re-introducing wolves.

Surprisingly enough, both camps want to manage ecosystems. The
difference lies in the role of wolves. Let's try to unpack both
arguments.

One of the most popular videos on wolf reintroduction is called “How
Wolves Change Rivers”. If you have not watched it, I would urge you to
take a moment to go see it.

```{=html}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysa5OBhXz-Q?si=JRjLG00jUgYS1HTG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

The video outlines that reintroducing wolves in the Yellowstone National
Park had profound impacts on the local ecology. Wolves have been
responsible for moving the elk herds to such a degree that aspen and
willow populations started regenerating. This in turn allowed beavers to
return who started building dams and creating wetlands which attracted
various songbirds, fish and amphibians.

A key concept of trophic cascades is mentioned in the video. [Trophic
cascades](https://www.britannica.com/science/trophic-cascade) is defined
as

> an ecological phenomenon triggered by the addition or removal of top
> predators and involving reciprocal changes in the relative populations
> of predator and prey through a food chain, which often results in
> dramatic changes in ecosystem structure and nutrient cycling.

In short, wolves have been attributed to altering the trophic cascades
in Yellowstone.

This is where the anti-wolf rhetoric comes in. For starters, the concept
of trophic cascades is [highly
debated](https://qcnr.usu.edu/labs/macnulty-lab/files/smith-et-al-2016a.pdf)
in the scientific community. More specifically, it is around the
magnitude of the overall impact. The question is 'Have wolves actually
impacted plants?'

Diane talks about this in the book as well

> Researchers, however, have shown that elk populations are affected by
> a combination of climate change, drought, fire, winter severity,
> grizzly bears, black bears, mountain lions, coyotes, and human
> hunters, in addition to wolves. Sorting out which component has had
> the most impact on elk has not yet been accomplished and likely never
> will be; relationships between weather, plant productivity, animal
> nutrition, carnivore and elk use of space, and competition between
> several species of animals are intricately entwined.

If I were to put on my statistics hat, this is a classic example of
'confounding variables', i.e. mulitple variables that could potentially
have an impact on the relationship between the dependent and the
independent variables. So according to Diane, to say that wolves have
been responsible for influencing local ecosystems might be a big stretch
especially when factors like weather patterns may be at play.

This brings us to a follow-up question "Are wolf reintroductions
warranted?"

To answer that question, some historical context is necessary.

Up until the 1900s, wolf populations were rapidly declining as they were
being trapped, hunted and poisoned. Wolves were almost driven to the
brink of extinction and it wasn't until late 20th century when
regulations like the Endangered Species Act in 1974 put them in an
endangered category. Eventually, wolf populations started rebounding and
recolonizing landscapes across North America and Europe from which they
had been extirpated a hundred years earlier. This trend was being
observed across the world and now thanks to the recovery efforts, *Canis
lupus is* considered to be of [Least
Concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-concern_species "Least-concern species")
by the [International Union for Conservation of
Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature "International Union for Conservation of Nature")
(IUCN).

Another equally controversial aspect of the wolf reintroduction debate
is ballot box biology, i.e. the act of putting biological decision
making up for popular vote. Wildlife conservationists seem to love it
whereas hunters vehemently hate it. The way I look at it is that both
sides have reasonable arguments. On one hand, it is a fairly democratic
process by letting the majority decide the outcome. The argument against
that would be how can you expect the majority to decide when they don't
even have a skin in the game. In other words, how can city dwellers
expect to understand the problems of rural folks who have to deal with
these wildlife encounters?

We also need to factor in our complex relationship with these creatures.
Throughout human history and across cultures, the image of the 'Big Bad
Wolf' has lived on. Yet, when we look at the stats that Diane shares in
the book, the fear almost seems irrational.

-   [Studies suggest that dog bites account for tens of millions of
    injuries annually](https://archive.ph/O1pny). While dog bites can
    result in serious and sometimes disfiguring injuries, most canine
    attacks are not deadly. In fact, only around 30 to 50 people die due
    to dog bites annually.

-   Over [130 attacks by mountain
    lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_cougar_attacks_in_North_America#cite_note-2)
    have been documented in North America in the past 100 years, with 28
    attacks resulting in fatalities.

-   [From 2000 to 2020, 25 people were killed by wild black
    bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America)
    across North America, roughly one attack per year. In the last 20
    years, approximately 30 to 40 people were killed by grizzlies in
    North America.

-   [Cows kill roughly 20
    people](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-024-00786-8)
    per year in the U.S.

-   Approximately, two people are killed annually in the [U.S. after
    tipping over a vending
    machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_vending_machine).

-   [In North America, approximately two dozen attacks (mostly
    non-fatal) of people by wild
    wolves](https://brage.nina.no/nina-xmlui/handle/11250/2729772?locale-attribute=en)
    have been documented in the past one hundred years. Some of these
    people were bitten by rabid wolves and eventually died from rabies
    rather than from the initial bite. Only two human fatalities have
    been documented in North America in the past 25 years.

Is this to say wolves are not dangerous? Absolutely not. They are highly
intelligent, apex predators and we should avoid them as much as we can.
But there is something to be said about our relationship with wolves. It
almost seems paradoxical that the direct descendants of wolves became
'man's best friend'. Yet our fear lives on.

![Evolution works in mysterious ways](images/proxy-image.jpg)

Daine perfectly sums up this ongoing discussion on wolf recovery and
reintroductions:

> Wolf recovery is all about people and very little about wolves. Wolf
> management comes down to human management.

Despite our best efforts to eradicate them, they have managed to
survive. According to Diane, it is because wolves are extremely
resilient. It's part of the reason why they are now dispersed across
Canada, Alaska, parts of the lower 48 states, Mexico, most of western
Europe, Israel, and India.

I almost feel like Dr. Ian Malcom from Jurassic Park doing his famous
"Life Finds a Way" speech.

```

Wolves just happen to be a living testament to that statement. Somehow
they found a way to live with us along with millions of other species.

As the world continues to change, one of the things we will need to
navigate is how do we coexist not just with wolves but other species as
well. Like it or not, the fate of almost every species on this planet is
in our hands. The question is - what are we going to do with it?
